# Working with WebEngine Add-in for Excel

In many enterprises, Excel is used a lot to do data related works. Many test teams use it to manage Test Data for manual or Automated Tests.
Web Engine Excel Add-in is built to easily manage test data and execute tests on local computer.

The add-in can be used by all team members:
* Testers and Product Owners can define and maintain test data, launch automated tests and observe the execution.
* Test Automation Engineers and Developers can develop and debug the test solution.

## Overview

* Export test data from Excel to xml files.
* Launch test executions.
* Define generation and execution options.
