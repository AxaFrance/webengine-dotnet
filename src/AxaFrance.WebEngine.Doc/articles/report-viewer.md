## When report is generated?
Each test execution via `WebRunner.exe` or `webrunner.jar` generates a test report in the given directory provided by `-outputDir` parameter.
When tests are launched with option `-showReport`, the report viewer will be launched automatically after test execution.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> DO NOT use option `-showReport` when the test is launched on a DevOps platform.
> It will show an UI based application on remote server which may cause problems.
