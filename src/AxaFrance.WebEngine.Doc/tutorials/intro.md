# Tutorials & Samples
In this series of documentation, we will learn how to develop Test Automation Solutions with the WebEngine Framework, and how this Framework can help you build these solutions easier and faster.

## Selenium WebDriver
AXA WebEngine Framework is based on Selenium WebDriver. In this document we assume that you know already following basic concepts of Selenium:

* Locator Strategies: That is use Class name, Css selector, Id, Name, Xpath or other locators to identify one or more specific elements in the DOM.
* Find Web Elements: By using functions of FindElement (by id, by name, by xpath ...)
* Interactions: Like Click on a button, Fill a Textbox, Select an option from Radio button group...

> [!NOTE]
> In this tutorials, we won't discuss basic concepts of Selenium and Selenium WebDriver. For these subjects, please refer to the [documentation of Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/)
>
> For Mobile related concepts, please refer to the [documentation of Appium](https://appium.io/docs/en/about-appium/intro/)

## Basic Concepts
Understand basic concepts about
* [How to identify UI Elements on Web Application](web-elements.md)
* [How to identify UI Elements on Mobile Application](app-elements.md)
* [How to organize UI Elements into a Page Model](page-model.md)
* How to initialize Web Driver for [Web Testing](web-driver.md) and [Mobile App Testing](appium-driver.md)

## Test Approach and sample projects
