# AXA WebEngine Framework

A Test Automation Framework (TAF) is a set of guidelines, libraries for creating and designing test cases.
It is a conceptual part of the automated testing, provides common functionalities and best practices that helps Test Automation Engineers to create reliable, maintainable, and well-structured Test Automation Solutions (TAS).

AXA WebEngine Framework makes it easy to build highly effective test automation solutions for **Web**, **Mobile Web** and **Mobile App** testing.

Built by Test Guild of AXA France, available in **.NET** and **JAVA** and used by a dozen of test automation projects within AXA France. We decided to open source this framework to share our knowledge on Test Automation to the community and hope we can improve the framework and the quality of IT Systems together, of course 😉 .

## Why WebEngine Framework?
WebEngine Framework resolves some common issues that we can encounter in several test automation project and it simplifies the writing of test scripts.
* It supports all Selenium technologies based :
    * on Desktop Browsers 
    * Mobile Browsers on different Mobile Devices.
* Using **Browser Factory**, there is no need to download various selenium WebDriver when browser and its version changes.
* Description oriented **Web Element** identification and synchronization with browser out-of-box.
* Organizing Web Element in **Page Model** makes test scripts easy to read and to maintain.
* Fully object-oriented and compatible with **Keyword-Driven** and **Data-driven** approach.
* Compatible with another Unit test frameworks such as NUnit, Cucumber
* Easy configuration and Set-up for Execution: Run test directly from Excel, as well as on DevOps platforms
* Graphical test report.
* **Open Source**, free usage and let’s improve it together!
